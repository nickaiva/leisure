                <h3>Tips for singles or divorced</h3>
                <p>This is our first tip: in case you are in search of your next love affair, please consider well
                    visited or crowded, but quiet places,
                    where the music is not so loud. That way communication is easier.
                </p>
                <h3>Tips for pairs and young parents</h3>
                <p>This is another tip for the active lovers: please select a discreet place for your accomodation and
                    keep it quiet, or just let the music play too!</p>

                    to search our ratings page
                    for user feedback concerning value for money comparisons.
                </p>
                <h3>Tips for larger families</h3>
                <p>This is another tip for multimember families: one needs to select special places, or venues, which
                    offer various activities for all members of the family,
                    such as ranging from museums, cinemas with playgrounds for children, to swimming, biking, hiking or
                    wandering in the land.

                <h3>Tips for the elderly</h3>
                <p>This is another tip for the seniors in need of special medical attention. In case of emergency the
                    arrival time of an ambulance
                    will be long, depending on the season of the year and local weather. Please avoid isolated places
                    with limited access to pharmacies and physicians.

                <h4>Tips for nursuring your baby</h4>
                <p>This is another tip for young mothers: apart from Scandinavia, public breast feeding is not allowed
                    or
                    tolerated in most countries.
                    Although there are special rooms for nursuring your baby in big Malls, other public places miss that
                    feature. Always check beforehand
                    whether there is such a room available in the viccinity of the venue mentioned in the article.

                <h4>Tips for the handicapped</h4>
                <p>This is our hottest tip for the disabled: note that the car or motorcycle drivers,
                    always seem to park the wrong way, blocking the ramps, if any available. Calling the traffic police
                    won't solve the problem either. Moving with
                    a wheelchair to our suggested destination is not always feasible.
                    Please check beforehand with your favorite way or app, whether the venue mentioned is really
                    accessible for the handicapped too. Not all public transport or stations provide a ramp for the
                    disabled.
                    Sometimes the portable ramps are misplaced and the staff does not know how to use them, or just does
                    not bother.
                    Plan timely and start earlier then early, taking into account such time waste and inconvenience!</p>

                <h3>Tips for singles or divorced</h3>
                <p>Many of the upshots we discuss when we talk about the benefits of cycling are exercise related.
                    Reckon it might be easier to just go for a run?
                    Running is weight bearing – and therefore injury rates are higher. Cycling, by contrast to running,
                    is not weight bearing.
                    Cycling is an incredibly sociable sport. Grassroots cycling revolves around cycling club culture –
                    which in turn revolves around the Saturday or Sunday club run: several hours of riding at an
                    intensity that enables easy chat, interrupted only by a cafe stop (or the occasional puncture).
                    Joining a cycling club or group is an excellent way to grow your social circle, and if you’re new to
                    riding – you’ll probably find all the maintenance and training advice you may have been looking for
                    there, too.

                </p>
                <h3>Tips for pairs and young parents</h3>
                <p>Most of us know that sex is a good thing, but not everyone knows that it’s actually good for your
                    overall health. In fact, regular sex
                    could indeed prolong your life.
                    Dr Michael Roizen, who chairs the Wellness Institute at the Cleveland Clinic, says: “The typical man
                    who has 350 orgasms a year,
                    versus the national average of around a quarter of that, lives about four years longer.” Similar
                    findings were revealed for women.
                    So can cycling improve your sex life? Well – it builds some rather essential muscle groups.
                    Dr Matthew Forsyth, urologist and keen cyclist from Portland, Oregon, commented: “All these muscles
                    [worked on the bike] are used during intercourse.
                    The better developed these muscles, the longer and more athletic intercourse will be.”</p>

                <h3>What is the difference between swimming in the pool and swimming in the sea?</h3>
                <p> If you do not like clorine or the other chemicals used to clean the pool water, you can enjoy the
                    sea.
                    The salt water in the ocean will make you float better than in fresh water. This makes swimming a
                    little bit easier.
                    The sea could have all sorts of stuff in it depending on where you're swimming.
                    Usually it's primarily water and salt, but in areas with a lot of boat or shipping activity you
                    could have waste from that.
                    Beaches and oceans don't have lifeguards always on duty. They'll drive by and raise flags in case of
                    extreme currents and come out to help rescue
                    you if called, but unless it's a heavily populated public beach they're not always going to have
                    lifeguards stationed.
                    If you're careful and have people watching out for you, this should hopefully not be much of a risk.

                    power submits to a clever mind. Tennis is also a calorie eater, 476 per hour, but requires special
                    attention to avoid hurting your knees, ankles
                    and waist. One needs to rent a proper court in advance, the harder the court surface the faster the
                    game, but the worse for your knees.

                <h4>What are the main benefits of swimming?</h4>
                <p>As well as being fun, swimming is a great way to keep fit and healthy and make new friends.
                    Swimming is a sport activity that you can continue for a lifetime.Furthermore,
                    swimming is a low-impact activity that has many physical and mental health benefits.
                    Make sure you know how to swim and do so in a safe environment.Pools are usually supervised,
                    but only beaches with a blue flag have a lifeguard for specific daylight hours.

                <h2>Our Cooking counselor will guide you how to best enjoy yourself and amuse your beloved ones</h2>
                <h3><a href="https://www.acouplecooks.com/cooking-couple/">Cooking as a Couple </a></h3>
                <p>Despite what some people may say, cooking is hard. It’s difficult to learn, involves lots of trial
                    and error, takes time, and makes a mess.
                    It might not be feasible for everyone, but having a buddy in the kitchen is a lifesaver! If you want
                    to learn to cook or to eat healthy,
                    a friend or a spouse can help keep you going, encourage you when the going gets rough, and inspire
                    you to try new things.

                </p>
                <h3>Tips for pairs and young parents</h3>
                <p> A few reasons cooking with a partner or friend is better than solo:
                    You’ll enjoy quality time together. One thing we love about cooking: it’s quality time spent
                    together and puts food on the table (hello, multitasking!). Some of our favorite memories are being
                    in the kitchen with people we love.
                    You’ll bond over new experiences. There’s something about learning a new skill with someone that
                    tightens the bond. You’ll have plenty of “remember when” fodder, and you’ll grow together the more
                    you learn.
                    You’ll learn how to communicate better and build a team. With an activity that requires timely
                    coordination to achieve a common goal, communication is key! You’ll find any communication issues
                    start to ferret themselves out as you cook together more.
                    It’ll go twice as fast (well, faster). With two in the kitchen, prep time flies by. You also can
                    designate someone as cleanup crew, who follows right behind the mess maker (we do this all the
                    time).
                    It’s more fun. I love cooking alone, but turn on some music, give me a glass of wine, and put my
                    husband by my side — that’s what I call cooking!</p>

                <h3>Tips for larger families</h3>
                <p>Involving your children in food preparation (maybe by asking them to read the recipe out loud or mix
                    ingredients) is not only a fun thing to do,
                    but also a great way to teach them healthy eating habits.

                <h3>Tips for the elderly</h3>
                <p>This is another tip for the seniors in need of special medical attention. In case of emergency the
                    arrival time of an ambulance
                    will be long, depending on the season of the year and local weather. Please avoid isolated places
                    with limited access to pharmacies and physicians.

                <p>Craft is no longer the sole preserve of small people with glitter glue and older people with knitting
                    needles.

                    More and more, it seems, adults are seeking to better themselves and digitally detox by making stuff
                    of one kind or another.

                    Certainly, when it comes to giving presents, the market for experiences is expanding fast and a
                    well-chosen craft kit offers both that and a lasting artefact in one gift.

                    For many, there is something undeniably satisfying about creating things oneself, even in an era
                    when you could almost certainly purchase a better version of the same thing online.</p>
